Each regional network contains multiple marine parks further divided into IUCN zones with varying levels of protection. National Park Zones (NPZs) prohibits any unauthorized extractive activities including recreational and commercial fishing. NEFSC is assisting Parks Australia in implementing a passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) approach to improve understanding of vessel use within the NPZs (Fig. 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Overview map of all deployments as of 05/2021.\nWe are currently using a hybrid analytical approach which combines an automated detector with manual review of a long-term spectral average (LTSA) to maximize the number of detected vessels. For each vessel detection, we review the finer-scale spectrogram to determine more precise duration and vessel behavior. After the initial selections have been made, we also use a basic transmission loss model to estimate possible source levels and ranges of each vessel in order to determine how many vessels are likely to occur within the NPZ boundaries.\n\nRaven Presets Used in Vessel Analysis\nPage Sound:\n\nPage size: 180 seconds\n\nPage increment: 90 percent\n\nStep increment: 10 percent\n\nFile name template: .&lt;yy&gt;&lt;ll&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;hh&gt;&lt;mm&gt;&lt;ss&gt;\nBrightness: 44\nContrast: 71\nFFT: 4096\n0-10 kHz\nEP D2b 6/13/2019 as example\n\n\n\nAMP Dolphin Protocol\n\n\nAustralian Marine Parks Manual Browsing Protocol"

    "text": "Life in the ocean provides unique navigational, foraging, and socializing challenges for marine mammals. As a result, they have adapted complex communication systems. The complex acoustic signals span from tonal (continuous sounds likely consisting of frequency modulation - meaning that the energy over the course of the signal changes frequency) to pulsed (rapid burst) sounds. Tonal sounds are strongly linked to socializing events, while pulsed sounds are typically linked to navigation and foraging. However, there are exceptions in odontocete call types such as sperm whale codas.\nForaging calls\nWhile all members of the cetacean family exhibit complex communication, odontocetes have evolved a unique tool that baleen whales do not possess; echolocation. Odontocetes produce echolocation clicks. They have air sacs beneath their blowhole that they release through phonic “lips” (also known as “monkey lips”), which then is focused through their melon - consisting of fatty tissue with similar densities to seawater - that allow the pulsed signal to be focused and transmit better in water. The sound waves from these signals reflect off objects, providing valuable information about environmental topography, prey, etc. Foraging odontocetes also produce ‘buzz’ sounds, a series of rapid echolocation clicks. Different odontocete groups produce clicks at different ranges, known as the interclick interval (see below), which can be used to help identify the sound source.\nSocial calls\nMany odontocetes exhibit socializing calls, including whistles and burst pulses. Whistles are one of the most studied odontocete vocalizations, and are frequency modulated, narrow-band calls. Many dolphin species adopt a ‘signature whistle’ in their first few years of life, which is equivalent to that animal’s “name”. Burst pulses are another social call-type. These are high-frequency pulsed calls, which are emitted quickly and typically broadband. However, they can be difficult to describe as they are incredibly variable. Depending on the species, burst pulses can be described as creaks, squacks, barks, and pops. It is important to note, not all species whistle/and or produce burst pulses.\nSee our odontocete study species below for more information. Our species list is organized by sperm whale, dolphins, beaked whales, and narrow band high-frequency (NBHF) species (Porpoise, Kogiidae). Each section includes call types, spectra imagery, and wigner plots if applicable.",

Broadband species produce clicks with a wide frequency range, and consists of Bottlenose and Common dolphins.\n\nThe second delphinid group is characterized by clicks with an amplitude peak within the 30 - 50 kHz frequency range. See figure for 30-50 kHz peak click spectra and species composition.\n\nThe final delphinid group is characterized by low frequency, high amplitude clicks. These are our blackfish species, which are also our largest delphinid species - false killer whales and pilot whales. Blackfish, along with belugas and narwhals, are unique in their ability to biphonate- produce multiple frequency sounds simultaneously. This occurs in their pulsed calls (see below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpectrographic example of a pilot whale pulsed call. Calls may consist of two components, an upper frequency component (UFC) that is a narrow-band tone, and a lower frequency component (LFC) that is a broadband pulse. The pulse repetition rate (PRR) is reflected by the sideband interval (SBI).

The Passive Acoustics Branch has a directory called PassiveAcoustic_Soundfiles where all legacy and new data are stored, including acoustic data and all ancillary data associated with PAM deployments. See the Server Structure page for more information.\n\n\nNational PAM GCP\nThe National PAM Google Cloud Project (GCP) is a cloud-based repository used for operational storage and archiving of passive acoustic data, associated ancillary data, and acoustic analysis outputs. All seven NOAA Fisheries PAM programs have access, ownership, and administrative privileges to their own buckets for data storage. The PAB buckets all begin with the prefix “nefsc-1”. For more information on accessing and using GCP cloud storage or processing services visit the National PAM Lab Manual cloud project page. For more information about what PAB data is stored in the cloud, view the PAB Google Smartsheet.\n\n\nNCEI Passive Acoustic Data Archive\nThe National Center for Environmental Information Passive Acoustic Data Archive is a publicly accessible data archive that can be used by any PAM data provider and accessed by any member of the public. Some PAB data and data products, including data collected as part of the SanctSound and ONMS Sound Monitoring Projects, are available in the NCEI PAD.\n\n\n\nMetadata Repositories\n\nMakara Database\nMakara is a metadatabase that stores all essential deployment and acoustic recording metadata in an organized and easy to query schema. The metadatabase is in the final stages of development and more details on accessing and using the database will be coming soon. Makara will be available for use by any PAM data provider, internal or external to NOAA Fisheries. If permission is provided by the data owner, all species detections will be made publicly available and automatically visualized on the Passive Acoustic Cetacean Map. Use of Makara will also format data in a way that can be exported and directly used to create standard data visualization products in R using the PAMverse packages.\n\n\n\nData Visualization Repositories\n\nPACM\nThe Passive Acoustics Cetacean Map (PACM) is an interactive platform in which users can view acoustic detections of numerous cetacean species. The visualization dashboard allows users to apply filters to the data including the species of interest, acoustic technology used, or select specific time periods. Current developments will expand PACM to be a National decision support tool allowing users to draw a bounding box on the map and request access to the data within the box. Requests for data will be managed by the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium.\n\n\nWhale Map\nThis website includes an interactive map displaying near real time passive acoustic detections of North Atlantic Right Whales, visual observations, and management measures taken to protect the species, such as vessel slow zones or seasonal management areas. Platform users can also access the portal to report sightings and dead or distressed whales.",

Our bottom-mounted moorings use acoustic releases to prevent the need for benthic-to-surface vertical line. We use different mooring designs depending on our field sites (refer to field methods for more detail on mooring designs). Below is a list of our mooring hardware components, including our mooring’s primary instruments (SoundTraps, F-PODs, VR2ARs) and auxiliary hardware.\n\nPrimary components\n\nSoundTrap: Ocean Instruments\n\n\nPAB’s primary recorder due to relatively long battery life and large memory, and broad sampling rate. We typically record at 48kHz providing data for most cetaceans, fish and soundscapes. This sampling rate allows for deployments of about 5 months.

Gliders can be outfitted with many different instruments, including passive acoustic recording packages and DMON, which is a WHOI-built acoustic recorder that automatically runs LFDCS. They are able to transmit data back in near real time using an iridium satellite or cellular link as well as storing the data on-board until it is retrieved.

Typically, they are towed horizontally behind a vessel and collect passive acoustic data in real time, but they can also be suspended vertically from a stationary mooring or vessel. The most simple array is a linear one in which all hydrophones are arranged in one plane (usually x) and therefore localization occurs in 2D, but there are also volumetric arrays, which have the hydrophones arranged in the x,y, and z planes for 3D localization. Using towed arrays on ship-board surveys are particularly useful for pairing vocalizations with under-studied species.\n\n\n\n\n\nLab Protocols\n\n\n\nDASBRs\n\n\nDASBRs (Drifting Acoustic Spar Buoy Recorders) are floating, mobile platforms that drift, typically incorporating a Soundtrap or other hydrophone components.

It is very strange that they did not last longer (5 years estimated life expectancy), but once you replace them, you will be prompted to reset the battery indicator within the VUE software. Vue should then indicate that they are at 100% again with the new batteries. You can then monitor the percentages in future deployments; if they continue to drop towards 25% quickly (within a year or two), then the receiver may be faulty or would at least warrant a call to Innovasea/Vemco to see what might be going on.\n\nWeb resources:\n\nINNOVAsea: When should I replace acoustic release battery?\n\nINNOVAsea: How to change the AA release battery\n\n\nFlooded ST600s\n\nSent them back to Ocean Instruments to be fixed\n\nEmail chains:\n\nFirst ST600s flooded\n\nInstructions for return\n\n\nST600 Battery bay malfunction\n\nLots of advice from John Atkins - ended up needing to send back to be fixed\n\nEmail chains:\n\nST600 with one battery bay nonfunctional\n\n\nST600 clock drift\n\nOutcome - John Atkins was going to push a universal fix for this\n\nEmail chains:\n\nClock Drift\n\nFix clock drift manually\n\nThis email conversation can also be found on the server here: \\\\stellwagen.nefsc.noaa.gov\\stellwagen\\MANUALS_SOFTWARE_CODE LIBRARY\\HARDWARE\\SoundTraps\n\n\nST600 Broken Hydrophone\n\nNeed to be sent back for repair\n\nEmail chain:\n\nBroken hydrophone\n\n\nApollo Beacon Voltage\n\nInfo on when to switch out batteries 2v is low, 2.5v is plenty\n\nEmail chain:\n\nApollo beacon battery voltage\n\n\nFPOD Batteries\n\nInfo on what types of batteries are compatible with FPODs\n\nAdditional resources:\n\nFPOD battery guide from manual\n\n\nPiston phone ST calibration\n\nHow to use the pistonphone to calibrate the STs\n\nEmail chain:\n\nPistonphone protocol\n\n\nHydrophone bonding issue for ST600s serial # &lt;7000 \n\nThe bond between the hydrophone and ST600 for serial #s prior to the 7000’s can degrade over time.

    "text": "Detectors and Classifiers\nFor more information on detectors, see Analysis protocol pages\n\nLow-Frequency Detection and Classification System (LFDCS) Baleen Whale Detector and Classifier\nLow-frequency tonal detector for baleen whales; written by Mark Baumgartner, see Baumgartner and Mussoline 2011\n\nReference guide includes instructions for installing the desktop version of the LFDCS and the fundamentals of that program: the generation of pitch tracks (contour lines that trace tonal sounds), building and managing a call library, browsing/exporting autodetections and analysis results, and species-specific analysis protocols.\n\n\n\nPAMguard\nThe PAMGuard software provides a suite of Detection, Classification, and Localization algorithms developed specifically for the many types of sounds made by different species. The algorithms are backed up by a powerful user interface that allows a human operator to view sounds in real time, confirm the output of the automatic detectors, and mark out sounds manually when automatic detection is not possible (Pamguard.org).\n\nUser/download guide\n\n\n\nTRITON\nTriton has multiple remoras for various acoustic analyses. Triton detectors are built under the Marine Bioacoustic Research Collaborative Github organization,and encompass anthropogenic, blue whale, and fish detectors.\n\nGithub\n\nUser guide\n\n\n\nBANTER\nBANTER is a supervised classification algorithm written in R. It requires minimal human intervention, providing more consistent results with fewer biases and errors than manual classification. Can be applied to anthropogenic, marine organisms, and terrestrial organisms. Developed by Shannon Rankin and Frederick Archer of SWFSC Marine Mammal and turtle division (User guide).\n\nBANTER User’s Guide *If the NEFSC PAB has its own BANTER user guide, add here\n\nBANTER CRAN\n\nBANTER Github\n\n\n\n\nSoundscape Analysis Software\n\nManta\nUtilizes Java 64-bit (version 11 or higher).\n\nUser/download guide\n\nManta: A clustering algorithm for weighted ecological networks\n\n\n\nPypam\nPypam facilitates processing of *.wav files resulting from underwater acoustic deployments. It enables application of existing methods of acoustic data processing, and it allows the processing of several deployments with one line of code, so it is easy to create datasets to work with. Pypam is oriented to extracting features that can be used for machine learning algorithms or to the extraction of broad acoustic information in time-series. Pypam can be used via R.\n\nGithub\n\nPypam quickstart\n\n\n\nPAMGuide\nWe use PAMGuide (Merchant et al. 2015) to calculate long-term power spectra density (PSD), broadband sound pressure level (BB SPL), and third-octave levels (TOL). Typically, this is done for an entire deployment; however, shorter subsets of .wav files (e.g., daily or weekly) can also be used to analyze temporal differences within a single deployment. PAMGuide can be used via Matlab or R (see ‘Generic Softwares’).\n\nMerchant et al. 2015\n\n\n\n\nValidation and Analysis tools\n\nSoundScope\nSoundScope is a python-based software that facilitates the visualization and manual verification of detections from automatic whale and fish sound detectors (or any other sound detectors). It allows to display and navigate through detections time series, filter and sort by classification confidence, and dynamically produce spectrograms of the detections. SoundScope was initially created in the Juanes Lab at the University of Victoria and is currently being developed at the Passive Acoustic Branch of NOAA’s Northeast Fisheries Science Center (Github README).\n\nGithub\n\n\n\nRaven Pro\nRaven Pro is a powerful research and teaching application for scientists needing flexible visualization and measurement tools for analysis of audio recordings of any length.

Federal regulators, meanwhile, are considering drastic measures to protect the whales against deadly entanglement in fishing gear and rope. So the question of where and when the whales are swimming in relation to Maine’s lobster fishery is gaining urgency. Now, new efforts are underway to pinpoint their travel habits.\n\n\nOpening Our Ears to the Ocean - WCAI All Things Considered (2/22/21)\nMany of us are familiar with the song of the humpback whale or the clicking of dolphin echo-location but we may not have considered the design, engineering, and field work necessary to collect those sounds. Captain Bob Wallace and Biologist Peter Tyack join us to discuss the pioneering work of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution bio acoustic engineer Bill Watkins, and how his recordings helped launch the marine mammal conservation movement.\n\n\nScientists Use New Tech To Detect Presence Of Endangered Right Whales Off Maine’s Coast - Maine Public Radio: Here and Now (2/21/20)\nNew acoustic monitors off Maine’s coast have detected the presence of North Atlantic right whales this winter. Scientists are trying to gather new data on the endangered animals’ whereabouts.\n\n\nFish and Ships: Unfortunatley, Not a Great Combination - WCAI Living Lab Radio (12/18/17)\nYou probably knew that whales make sounds to communicate. But did you know that fish are chatting down there, too? It turns out that fish are bothered by ship noise a lot like whales are. A new study looked at haddock and cod, two commercially important fish species, to find out more about how fish are managing in an increasingly noisy ocean\n\n\nScientists, Fishing Fleet Team Up To Save Cod - By Listening - NPR: The Salt (6/15/15)\nIn the ocean off of Massachusetts, an unlikely alliance of scientists and fishermen is on a quest. They’re looking for mating codfish. The goal is not only to revive a depleted fish population but to save an endangered fishing community as well.\n\n\nEavesdropping on the Private Lives of Cod - WCAI Living Lab Radio (2/16/15)\nIf you want to protect New England’s most iconic fish and still allow fishermen to catch them, it’s critical to know when and where they reproduce. The trouble is, we don’t.\n\n\nScientists Pinpoint Source of Antarctic ‘Quack’ - NPR All Things Considered (4/23/14)\nFor decades, researchers and submarine crews in icy waters off the coast of Antarctica have been picking up a mysterious quacking sound. The “bio-duck,” as its called, has been heard on and off since Cold War patrols picked it up on sonar during the 1960s. Marine biologist Denise Risch sheds light on what the sound source may be.\n\n\nMinke Sounds like No Whale You’ve Ever Heard - WCAI Cape and Islands NPR Station (3/20/14)\nDenise Risch of NEFSC and her colleagues are trying to understand which whales use which types of calls and under what circumstances. They placed underwater microphones on the sea floor in Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary. Those listening devices have tracked 18 minke whales and led to the identification of seven distinct types of calls, or pulse trains. But there are still plenty of unknowns.\n\n\nHow Acoustic Monitoring Could Help Protect Cod Stocks - WCAI Cape and Islands NPR Station (4/4/13)\nHere’s your science factoid of the day: male Atlantic cod grunt during spawning season. It may sound like useless trivia, but that behavior could help fishery managers better protect cod stocks.\n\n\nMapping Noise Pollution to Save Marine Life - The Takeaway (12/19/12)\nTo many, our planet’s oceans appear peaceful.

The Passive Acoustics Branch has a directory called PassiveAcoustic_Soundfiles where all legacy and new data are stored, including acoustic data and all ancillary data associated with PAM deployments. See the Server Structure tab for more information.\n\n\nNational PAM GCP\nThe National PAM Google Cloud Project (GCP) is a cloud-based repository used for operational storage and archiving of passive acoustic data, associated ancillary data, and acoustic analysis outputs. All seven NOAA Fisheries PAM programs have access, ownership, and administrative privileges to their own buckets for data storage. The PAB buckets all begin with the prefix “nefsc-1”. For more information on accessing and using GCP cloud storage or processing services visit the National PAM Lab Manual cloud project page. For more information about what PAB data is stored in the cloud, view the PAB Google Smartsheet.\n\n\nNCEI Passive Acoustic Data Archive\nThe National Center for Environmental Information Passive Acoustic Data Archive is a publicly accessible data archive that can be used by any PAM data provider and accessed by any member of the public. Some PAB data and data products, including data collected as part of the SanctSound and ONMS Sound Monitoring Projects, are available in the NCEI PAD.\n\n\n\nMetadata Repositories\n\nMakara Database\nMakara is a metadatabase that stores all essential deployment and acoustic recording metadata in an organized and easy to query schema. The metadatabase is in the final stages of development and more details on accessing and using the database will be coming soon. Makara will be available for use by any PAM data provider, internal or external to NOAA Fisheries. If permission is provided by the data owner, all species detections will be made publicly available and automatically visualized on the Passive Acoustic Cetacean Map. Use of Makara will also format data in a way that can be exported and directly used to create standard data visualization products in R using the PAMverse packages.\nData Visualization Repositories\n\n\nPACM\nThe Passive Acoustics Cetacean Map (PACM) is an interactive platform in which users can view acoustic detections of numerous cetacean species. The visualization dashboard allows users to apply filters to the data including the species of interest, acoustic technology used, or select specific time periods. Current developments will expand PACM to be a National decision support tool allowing users to draw a bounding box on the map and request access to the data within the box. Requests for data will be managed by the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium.\n\n\nWhale Map\nThis website includes an interactive map displaying near real time passive acoustic detections of North Atlantic Right Whales, visual observations, and management measures taken to protect the species, such as vessel slow zones or seasonal management areas. Platform users can also access the portal to report sightings and dead or distressed whales."

The process consists of generating 4 QAQC output figures in R then manually reviewing this output using an interactive Shiny app. This process is currently set up to reference multiple deployments worth of data following the organizational structure of the NEFSC server. Other users can generate the 4 QAQC figures independently, then point to the appropriate file directory to use the Shiny App for interactive evaluation of the output figures. See below for details on these components.\n\nShiny App\nThe purpose of this app is to give users a simple interactive method of viewing the generated QAQC output data and making note of any potential issues present. The app can be started by running the runQAQCReview function and giving it the folder where the QAQC_Log.csv is stored as an input. This will open up the Shiny app in a browser window, defaulting to the Home tab. You can navigate to other tabs by clicking on them.\n\n\n\nIssue log: Issues can be logged directly in time-series plots using the Shiny app.\n\n\nThe Shiny app produces the following output figures:\n\n\nTOL - Third Octave Levels\nThe TOL tab shows the TOL plot for the selected project, using the second 60 seconds of every wav file. The shown time range can be adjusted using the slider bar Time Range below the plot, and frequencies can be removed from the display by unchecking the relevant box under Frequency to Show. TOL plots are inspected to evaluate recorder performance and identify any compromised frequencies.\n\n\n\nData gap time series plots\nThe Data Gaps tab shows two plots on the same time scale. The top plot shows the time between the start of each recording file (in seconds) - generally these should be the same value, except for the first file which may have been shortened (and the last value is always 0). The bottom plot shows the time between the actual end of one recording file (taken as start time + actual duration) and the reported start of the next recording file. Generally these should be 0, though periodic jumps of 1 second occur (this typically happens because file names are rounded to a full second, and file durations can be off by fractions of a second - so eventually these fractions of a second add up to a file time needing to change by a full second). Similarly to the TOL plot, the displayed times can be adjusted using the Time Range slider.\n\n\n\nTemperature and voltage time series plots\nThe Temp Volt panel shows the temperature and voltage time series plots, if the project did not use a Soundtrap recorder then this will display a message that no data is available. If any anomalies are present, you can select a time region on the plot, add a comment and hit the Log Issue button. The values of the temperature and voltage will be stored with the note along with the start and end times of the region selected and their corresponding recording files. Depending on the Soundtrap model, sometimes both internal and external battery data will be shown here.",

Although they do not echolocate like their odontocete relatives, they still produce a complex variety of sounds to communicate (and in some cases, to navigate). As larger species, baleen vocalizations tend to be low frequency and propogate far distances. Recent research has hypothesized that these properties additionally help baleen species evade predators such as killer whales, which can’t hear such low frequency sounds.\nThe following is a list of Mysticete species monitored by NEFSC Passive Acoustic Branch.

These are low-frequency calls, generally in the range of 15-40 Hz and are difficult to hear. Blue whale calls may be more audible if sped up by a factor of 2, 3 or more.\n\n\n\n\nIn general, blue whales in the North Atlantic will produce three main sound types: songs with a variety of regularly repeated, relatively long song units (i.e., A-B-AB song), shorter down sweeping calls (i.e., D calls) that they produce irregularly and in pattern, and arch calls. A-B-AB songs consist of units, each lasting 15-20 s in the 19-16 Hz range. Usually the A calls are shorter and flatter, while the B calls are typically longer and slope downward. Calls can be produced as single calls or combined into A, B, or AB phrases which can be repeated to form bouts of song.

    "text": "Fin whale\n\n\nScientific name: Balaenoptera physalus\nMakara species code: FIWH\n\nFin whales can produce a variety of low frequency sounds, some of which reach intensities as loud as 184-186 dB re 1 mPa (Charif et al., 2002; Richardson et al., 1995). Song patterns can be unique to fin whales in certain regions and can be used to identify different populations.\n\n\n\n\nThe most common fin whale calls are the 20-Hz pulse (also called “A notes” or “20-Hz notes”). These are stereotypes, frequency-modulated downsweeps, the most common of which has a dominant frequency of 25-17 Hz, usually centered around 20-Hz with an average duration of 1s (Morano et al., 2012). The inter-note interval (INI) can vary seasonally in the western North Atlantic with shorter INIs (~9.6s) occurring primarily in September-January, longer INIs (~15.2 s) occuring in March-May, and a transitional period occurring in February and June-August when the INI can vary (Morano et al., 2012).\nFin whales also produce back-beat pulses (also called “B notes”). These have a narrower bandwidth: 18-20 Hz (Clark et al., 2002), and are produced in a series or rotation with 20 Hz pulses.\n130 Hz calls have been documented both during songs and on their own, which is a higher upsweep frequency note at about 130 Hz (Papale et al., 2023). A study on Fin whale occurrence and acoustic patterns in Norway concluded these calls were most frequent during October and November months.\n40-Hz calls/downsweeps are characterized by higher frequency, down sweeping pulses of 70-30 Hz (Wiggins & Hildebrand, 2020). These have been occasionally observed but not yet documented in the literature for the North Atlantic. 40-Hz calls may function in a feeding context; these calls have been recorded in known feeding areas with whales engaged in long dives or surface feeding activities. Call rates generally increase with increasing prey biomass (Romagosa et al., 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall Types\n\n\nMakara call-type code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n130-Hz note\n\n\nFWNOTE\n\n\n\n\n20-Hz pulse\n\n\nFWPLS\n\n\n\n\nDownsweep/ 40-Hz call\n\n\nFWDS\n\n\n\n\nMixed calls\n\n\nFWMIX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpectrogram image of Fin whale 20-Hz pulse calls\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhile there are multiple call types described in this guide, the NEFSC Passive Acoustics Branch only uses 20-Hz pulses for determining daily presence of fin whales in our archival data.",

Songs are produced by males on breeding grounds, but can also occur on feeding grounds. While the purpose of song production is still under debate, it is hypothesized that song may function as male breeding displays, male-male social ordering, or a means for spacing reproductively active males (Darling & Berube, 2001). Song can also occur on feeding grounds (Clark & Clapham, 2004).\n\n\n\n\nHumpback songs can contain both tonal and impulsive sounds. Each individual sound is considered to be a “unit”, multiple units together make up a “phrase”, and “phrases that are repeated make up a”theme” (Payne & McVay, 1971). Song themes can change from year to year; some themes may stay the same while others might develop variations or be completley replaced. Humpback whales of both sexes also produce non-song vocalizations, termed ‘social sounds’ by Payne (1978) and Tyack (1982). These generally refer to any sounds that are not part of a song pattern, and have been associated with a range of behaviors such as feeding.\n\n\n\n\n\nCall Types\n\n\nMakara call-type code\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial\n\n\nHWSOC\n\n\n\n\nSong\n\n\nHWSONG\n\n\n\n\nMixed call\n\n\nHWMIX\n\n\n\n\n\n Humpback social calls\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhile song and non-song are both described in this guide, the NEFSC Passive Acoustics Branch only uses calls that are obviously part of a song pattern for determining daily presence of humpback whales in our archival data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHumpback song - 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHumpback Social calls",

These fisheries contribute to New England fishery economies and are an important part of the local ecosystem. The results of our research has been used to support management decisions and increase protections for fishes during spawning.\nResearch suggests that around 1,000 species of fish produce sound. Many soniferous fishes have specialized muscles that beat against their swim bladders, producing low frequency drums, grunts, and knocking sounds. These acoustic signals are typically produced to deter predators, during feeding events, and/or during spawning events.\nPassive acoustic research has been used to described global variations in fish chorusing - a significant increase of fish sounds typically associated with spawning and often occurring during sunrise or sunset, or both depending on the community of fish species in the area. Chorusing can be a significant component of the marine soundscape - or the general acoustic characteristics and patterns of a given area - as the amplitude is loud enough to be identified on diel power spectral density plots (see below).\n\nPower Spectral Density (PSD) plots illustrate the range in amplitude for a given frequency in a recording.
