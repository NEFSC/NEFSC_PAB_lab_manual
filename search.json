It looks like a html book (type: book) but unlike the book type it only has html format and you will not have the download options. type: website is a common format for documentation.\nThe repo includes a GitHub Action that will build the website automatically when you make changes to the files. The webpage will use the gh-pages branch. Serving the website files from this branch is a common way to keep all the website files from cluttering your main branch.\nWarning: Check that the settings will allow the GitHub Action to run. See the instructions below under “GitHub Set-up”. Scroll down to the troubleshooting section if the website is not built by the GitHub Action.\nNote: The GitHub Action installs R so you can render qmd files with R code. You will need to edit to install Python or Julia if your qmd uses those instead. If you have substantial computations, you don’t want to be re-running all the computations for files that didn’t change. Read about the freeze option for this situation. R users with complex reports with dependencies (so qmd B depends on qmd A or data file A) should be aware of the {targets} package which will help you keep track of files that need to be re-rendered due to changes in dependencies.\n\n\n\nClick the green “Use This Template” button to make a repository with this content. Make sure to make your repo public (since GitHub Pages doesn’t work on private repos unless you have a paid account) and check box to include all the branches (so that you get the gh-pages branch). \nTurn on GitHub Pages under Settings &gt; Pages .
