The NEFSC Passive Acoustic Branch uses a variety of passive acoustic recording platforms to monitor sounds in the ocean. PAM deployments often consist of co-located hardware to collect ancillary data about the ocean or provide mechanisms to recover the instruments.

## Bottom-Mounted Mooring components

Bottom-mounted moorings are most commonly used for continuous monitoring at single location, providing long-term time series for marine mammals, fish, soundscapes, and anthropogenic noise. Our bottom mounted recorders use VEMCO acoustic release mechanisms to prevent the need for benthic-to-surface vertical line. We use different mooring designs for our three field sites (refer to [field methods](https://nefsc.github.io/NEFSC_PAB_lab_manual/content/FieldMethods/FieldMethods.html) for more detail on mooring designs). Below is a list of our mooring hardware components, including our mooring's primary components (Soundtrap, Fpods, VEMCOs) and auxiliary hardware. 

### Primary components

#### SoundTrap: [Ocean Instruments](https://www.oceaninstruments.co.nz/product/soundtrap-st600-std-long-term-recorder/)

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="90%"}

PABs primary instrument due to relatively long battery life and large memory, and broad sampling rate. Typical deployments consist of 5 month recording at 48kHz providing data for most cetaceans, fish and soundscapes.

#### F-POD: [Chelonia Wildlife Acoustic Monitoring](https://www.chelonia.co.uk/f-pod/)

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="90%"}

F-PODs are a high-resolution click detector used to identify delphinids. The instrument is calibrated, has a long battery life and is an integrated product that records audio and automatically detects clicks.

#### VEMCO Acoustic Telemetry and Release (order site \- [InnovaSea](https://www.innovasea.com/fish-tracking/products/acoustic-receivers/), VR2AR Acoustic Release Receiver)

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="90%"}

Acoustic telemetry release allows researchers to retrieve bottom-mounted recording devices using acoustic signalling. Using VEMCOs eliminates the need for surface buoys, mitigating whale entanglement risk. VEMCOs collect acoustic telemetry data, which is submitted to the Atlantic Cooperative Telemetry Network ([ACT](https://theactnetwork.com/) / [MATOS](https://matos.asascience.com/)).

### Auxiliary components 

#### Apollo X1 Satellite Beacon ([order site](https://xeostech.com/apollo-x1))

* The Apollo Satellite Beacon is used to monitor unplanned or accidental release of subsurface instrument moorings.

#### Hermes Beacon Locator ([order site](https://xeostech.com/hermes))

* The Hermes Beacon Locator is used to communicate with the Apollo Satellite Beacon to locate mooring units at sea

#### HOBO Temperature Loggers ([order site](https://www.onsetcomp.com/products/data-loggers/utbi-001))

* Small mechanism that logs temperature over long periods of time. Requires HOBOware software and either an Optic USB Base Station or HOBO Waterproof Shuttle (U-DTW-1).

#### VEMCO VR100 Deck Box ([order site](https://www.oceans-research.com/vr100/))

* The VEMCO Deck Box is used to remotely connect and communicate with the submerged VEMCO, primarily to release the VEMCO from the bottom-mounted weights.

#### VHTx: Transponding Hydrophone ([order site](https://www.oceans-research.com/vhtx/))

* Transponding hydrophone used for communication between VEMCO VR100 Deck Box and VEMCO Acoustic Release Receiver.

## Surface-Moored Platforms

### Moored Surface Buoy: Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution ([Robots4whales](https://robots4whales.whoi.edu/platforms/moored-buoy/))

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="90%"}

A WHOI-engineered quiet surface buoy specifically for acoustic applications. Data detection is delivered from DMON/LFDCS to a shore-side computer via Iridium satellite modem. DMON is the WHOI-built acoustic recorder that automatically runs [LFDCS](https://nefsc.github.io/NEFSC_PAB_lab_manual/content/Software/Software.html#low-frequency-detection-and-classification-system-lfdcs-baleen-whale-detector-and-classifier). NEFSC PAM has one WHOI-designed surface buoy to monitor real-time species presence in a leased wind farm region.

## Mobile Platforms

### Slocum Gliders: Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution ([Robots4whales](https://robots4whales.whoi.edu/platforms/slocum-glider/))

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}

Slocum gliders are useful for passive acoustic monitoring, as they can glide silently through vast depth ranges for months at a time. Can self-navigate using GPS systems, and can communicate with researchers via Iridium communication sessions. Gliders are equipped with DMON, which is a WHOI-built acoustic recorder that automatically runs [LFDCS](https://nefsc.github.io/NEFSC_PAB_lab_manual/content/Software/Software.html#low-frequency-detection-and-classification-system-lfdcs-baleen-whale-detector-and-classifier).

### Towed Array 

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}

A towed array is the acoustic sampling technique of dragging a recording device behind a moving ship, which usually allows the pairing of recording with visual ground-truthing. This method is particularly useful for pairing vocalizations with under-studied species.

## Technical Advice

<summary><font size = "5">Technical advice list</font></summary>


**When should I replace my VR2AR / ASCENT-AR acoustic release battery?**

* Replace the release motor AA batteries once they indicate they are approaching 25%. It is very strange that they did not last longer (5 years estimated life expectancy), but once you replace them, you will be prompted to reset the battery indicator within the VUE software. Vue should then indicate that they are at 100% again with the new batteries. You can then monitor the percentages in future deployments; if they continue to drop towards 25% quickly (within a year or two), then the receiver may be faulty or would at least warrant a call to Innovasea/Vemco to see what might be going on.

I don't see any of ours logged on there, if someone wants to and has a moment to log down our issues we've had? This is not a high priority by any means.

* Guidance on how to resolve a ST Host connection issue. Ocean Instruments is strongly recommending SoundTrap users from here on out use ST Host version 4.0.19, which is their most recent non-beta software release. I came across this on their most recent ST600 manual. No specific reason was given other than that it will ensure correct operation of the SoundTrap recorders.
