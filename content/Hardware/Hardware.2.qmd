The NEFSC Passive Acoustic Branch uses a variety of passive acoustic recording platforms to monitor sounds in the ocean. PAM deployments also often consist of co-located hardware to collect ancillary data about the ocean or provide mechanisms to recover the instruments.

## Bottom-Mounted Moorings

Bottom-mounted moorings are most commonly used for continuous monitoring at single location, providing long-term time series for marine mammals, fish, soundscapes, and anthropogenic noise. Our bottom mounted recorders use VEMCO acoustic release mechanisms to prevent the need for benthic-to-surface vertical line. We use different mooring designs for our three field sites:

## Moored Surface Buoy

#### Moored Surface Buoy: Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution ([Robots4whales](https://robots4whales.whoi.edu/platforms/moored-buoy/))

A WHOI-engineered quiet surface buoy specifically for acoustic applications. Data detection delivered from DMON/LFDCS to shore-side computer via Iridium satellite modem.

## Mobile Platforms

#### Slocum Gliders: Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution ([Robots4whales](https://robots4whales.whoi.edu/platforms/slocum-glider/))

Slocum gliders are useful for passive acoustic monitoring, as they can glide silently through vast depth ranges for months at a time. Can self-navigate using GPS systems, and can communicate with researchers via Iridium communication sessions.

#### Towed Array 

A towed array is the acoustic sampling technique of dragging a recording device behind a moving ship, which usually allows the pairing of recording with visual groundtruthing. This method is particularly useful for pairing vocalizations with under-studied species.

#### DASBRs 

DASBRs are floating, mobile platforms that typically incorporate Soundtrap and hydrophone components. DASBRs are typically deployed if Gervais’ beaked whales are sighted during offshore fieldwork. GPS will indicate location once the platform is ready to be retrieved.

**When should I replace my VR2AR / ASCENT-AR acoustic release battery?**

* Replace the release motor AA batteries once they indicate they are approaching 25%. It is very strange that they did not last longer (5 years estimated life expectancy), but once you replace them, you will be prompted to reset the battery indicator within the VUE software. Vue should then indicate that they are at 100% again with the new batteries. You can then monitor the percentages in future deployments; if they continue to drop towards 25% quickly (within a year or two), then the receiver may be faulty or would at least warrant a call to Innovasea/Vemco to see what might be going on.

**Cross-center SoundTrap Issue Documentation**

I don't see any of ours logged on there, if someone wants to and has a moment to log down our issues we've had? This is not a high priority by any means. Also I became aware of a [StackExchange page](https://bioacoustics.stackexchange.com/questions/242/st600-hardware-failures) that documents the known ST600 issues that I wanted to share with you.

**ST Host Software v4.0.19 and manual**

* Guidance on how to resolve a ST Host connection issue. Ocean Instruments is strongly recommending SoundTrap users from here on out use ST Host version 4.0.19, which is their most recent non-beta software release. I came across this on their most recent ST600 manual. No specific reason was given other than that it will ensure correct operation of the SoundTrap recorders.
