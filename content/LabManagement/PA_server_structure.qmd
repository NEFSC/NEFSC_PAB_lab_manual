# Passive Acoustics server structure
---
The Passive Acoustics server is our central storage location for all data and information that is not acoustic data. We are in the process of migrating from the PassiveAcoustics/Stellwagen\_Old directory to the PassiveAcoustics directories. For information on where we store acoustic data see the [PassiveAcoustic\_soundfiles server page](https://nefsc.github.io/NEFSC_PAB_lab_manual/content/DataManagement/PA_soundfiles.html). 

### Accessing the server

To access the server for the first time, submit an ITD ticket requesting access to PA\_group file shares and include Sofie or your team lead on the ticket so that they can provide approval.

To access from the Windows file explorer enter: \\\\nefscdata\\PassiveAcoustics\\  
To access from a container enter: \\\\mnt\\PassiveAcoustics\\

For quick access on your computer, it is recommended to pin the server folder.  
Make sure you are connected to the network via VPN.

### PassiveAcoustics server information

The table below details the status of the server reorganization and comments on how to use each folder. For more information on specific folders, see ‘Readme’ docs located in the server.
