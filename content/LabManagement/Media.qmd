Dr Scarlett Smash & Dr Craken MacCraic chat to Julianne Wilder about the whale calls, the effects of climate change and underwater sound research. They also chat about the  new paper she co-authored:  Exploring movement patterns and changing distributions of baleen whales in the western North Atlantic using a decade of passive acoustic data.

#### [Listening for Cod in the Gulf of Maine](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/podcast/listening-cod-gulf-maine)  - On the Line

Scientists and fishermen are working together to locate spawning aggregations of Atlantic cod. The goal is to allow cod and fishermen to each go about their business separately.

#### [In Fight Over Right Whales And Lobster Fishery, All Sides Want To Know More About Whale Activity Off Maine](https://www.mainepublic.org/environment-and-outdoors/2021-06-24/in-fight-over-right-whales-and-lobster-fishery-all-sides-want-to-know-more-about-the-whales-activities-off-maine) - Maine Public Radio: On Point
The historic migration patterns of endangered North Atlantic right whales have been changing in the last decade, possibly due to climate change. Federal regulators, meanwhile, are considering drastic measures to protect the whales against deadly entanglement in fishing gear and rope. So the question of where and when the whales are swimming in relation to Maine's lobster fishery is gaining urgency. Now, new efforts are underway to pinpoint their travel habits.

#### [Opening Our Ears to the Ocean](https://www.capeandislands.org/show/the-point/2021-02-22/opening-our-ears-to-the-ocean#stream/0) - WCAI All Things Considered
Many of us are familiar with the song of the humpback whale or the clicking of dolphin echo-location but we may not have considered the design, engineering, and field work necessary to collect those sounds. Captain Bob Wallace and Biologist Peter Tyack join us to discuss the pioneering work of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution bio acoustic engineer Bill Watkins, and how his recordings helped launch the marine mammal conservation movement. 

#### [Scientists Use New Tech To Detect Presence Of Endangered Right Whales Off Maine's Coast](https://www.mainepublic.org/environment-and-outdoors/2020-02-21/scientists-use-new-tech-to-detect-presence-of-endangered-right-whales-off-maines-coast) - Maine Public Radio: Here and Now
New acoustic monitors off Maine's coast have detected the presence of North Atlantic right whales this winter. Scientists are trying to gather new data on the endangered animals' whereabouts.
