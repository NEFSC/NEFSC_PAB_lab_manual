## Stock Assessment Surveys

### Atlantic Marine Assessment Program for Protected Species \- AMAPPS 

AMAPPS surveys are a multi-agency effort aimed at assessing abundance, distribution, ecology, and behavior of marine mammals, sea turtles, and seabirds throughout the U.S. Atlantic. NEFSC PAM researchers participate in AMAPPS surveys using towed array sampling methods. Using a towed array involves towing recording devices behind a ship and matching acoustic analysis with real-time on-deck visual observers for ground-truthing purposes. The towed array can collect species presence when whales are under water and unavailable to the observers, and during periods of inclement weather (e.g. rain, fog), extending survey efforts. Combining data collected from both the towed array and from the observers allows for a more holistic and comprehensive picture of species distribution and abundance in our offshore regions. For more information on the AMAPPS effort, see NOAA’s [AMAPPS page](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/population-assessments/atlantic-marine-assessment-program-protected).
