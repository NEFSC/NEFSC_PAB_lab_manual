* Code: MATLAB\_ANTHROPOGENIC\_FIXED

## Pile Driving Detector

Detector for pile driving associated with offshore wind energy development; developed by Xavier Mouy

* Code: PYTHON\_PILEDRIVING\_KURTOSIS

## Ship Detector

The Ship Detector Remora is a repository with user-friendly interfaces to detect ship passages and weather events from Long-Term Spectral Averages (LTSAs). This package was initially developed for this [Ph.D. thesis](https://upcommons.upc.edu/handle/2117/129269) and since then has been expanded for the [Sound Monitoring Project](https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/science/monitoring/sound/) to support Marine Protected Area management, as well as additional monitoring projects.

### GOM [Vessel Detection protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NGepbb8-vDmIcop8Ek-N2qNqQwnm7q_M/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116688690465000616014&rtpof=true&sd=true)

This protocol outlines the protocol for vessel detection in the GOM. Triton, a software created by SCRIPSS, in Matlab is used for each step in this project (\*Note: this protocol is using a container to access matlab). A subset of data was analyzed from SBNMS, Inshore GOM, and offshore GOM.
