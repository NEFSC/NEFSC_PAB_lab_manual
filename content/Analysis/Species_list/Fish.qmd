## Fish
The PAB lab collaborates with local fishery policy makers by acoustically monitoring for economically important species of fish. Stellwagen bank hosts herring, cod and haddock spawning grounds, supplementing New England fishery economies and feeding local biodiversity. 

Fish don't produce sounds the same way cetaceans do. Not all fish produce sounds at all. Those that do typically have specialized muscles that beat against their swim bladders, producing drums, grunts, and knocking sounds. Fish sounds are low-frequency in nature. These acoustic signals are produced to deter predators, during feeding events, and/or during spawning events. 

Passive Acoustic research has been used to described global variations in fish chorusing - a significant increase of fish sounds produced either in during sunrise, sunset, or both depending on the composition of fish species in the area. Chorusing contributes significantly to the marine 'Soundscape' - or the general acoustic characteristics and patterns of a given area - as the amplitude is loud enough to be identified on diel power spectral density plots (see below).

Power Spectral Density (PSD) plots illustrate the range in amplitude for a given frequency in a recording. This PSD plot depicts 24 hours of marine acoustic data in an Atlantic ecosystem. The orange and grean peaks indicate high amplitude (or loud) calls in the evening hour is attributed to fish chorusing.

#### Atlantic cod

**Scientific name**: *Gadus Morhua*  
**Makara species code**: ATCO  

Atlantic cod produce 'grunts' and 'hums' using drumming muscles against their swim bladders (similar to Haddock), producing sounds within 20 and 600 Hz (Seri, 2023). Primary Cod acoustic production occurs during spawning events, making passive acoustic monitoring a key tool in monitoring local spawning trends. Stellwagen Bank has been identified as a key spawning location for Atlantic Cod (Caiger, 2020).

#### Haddock 

**Scientific name**: *Melanogrammus aeglefinus*  
**Makara species code**: HADD  

Haddock produce drums and knocking sounds using sonic muscles attached to the gas bladder in the frequency range of 80-500 Hz. Mature males exhibit sexual dimorphism by having larger sonic muscles than females, but both sexes produce sounds (Templeman and Hodder, 1958). Haddock sound production increases during spawning events, and  exhibit different pulse structures at different stages of spawning (Hawkins and Rasmussen, 1978).

#### Herring

**Scientific name**: *Clupea Harengus*  
**Makara species code**: N/A

From our limited understanding of herring sound production, we know that herring produce burst pulses - also known as Fast Repetitive Tick (FRT) sounds. These are broadband pulse trains and last roughly 0.6 - 7.6 seconds. These sounds were documented to primarily occur at  night. Atlantic herring FRT sounds were attributed with bubble expulsion from the swim bladder (Wilson, 2004).

## Invertebrates 
We commonly record snapping shrimp in our acoustic data collected all along the eastern seaboard. They tend to remain on the seafloor, and tend to avoid mudflats and seagrass habitats. Snapping shrimp produce quick snaps that appear as broad-frequency lines in the background of spectrogram images. We cannot distinguish snapping shrimp species by this type of data. 

#### Snapping Shrimp

**Scientific name**: *Alpheus spp.*  
**Makara species code**: SNSH
