## Fish
The PAB lab collaborates with local fishery policy makers by acoustically monitoring for economically important species of fish. Stellwagen bank hosts herring, cod and haddock spawning grounds, supplementing New England fishery economies and feeding local biodiversity. 

Fish don't produce sounds the same way cetaceans do. Not all fish produce sounds at all. Those that do typically have specialized muscles that beat against their swim bladders, producing drums, grunts, and knocking sounds. Fish sounds are low-frequency in nature. These acoustic signals are produced to deter predators, during feeding events, and/or during spawning events. 

Passive Acoustic research has been used to described global variations in fish chorusing - a significant increase of fish sounds produced either in during sunrise, sunset, or both depending on the composition of fish species in the area. Chorusing contributes significantly to the marine 'Soundscape' - or the general acoustic characteristics and patterns of a given area - as the amplitude is loud enough to be identified on diel power spectral density plots (see below).

Power Spectral Density (PSD) plots illustrate the range in amplitude for a given frequency in a recording. This PSD plot depicts 24 hours of marine acoustic data in an Atlantic ecosystem. The orange and grean peaks indicate high amplitude (or loud) calls in the evening hour is attributed to fish chorusing.

Haddock knocks can be mistaken for [humpback whale calls](https://nefsc.github.io/NEFSC_PAB_lab_manual/content/Analysis/Species_list/Myst_list.html#humpback-whale)

## Invertebrates 
We commonly record snapping shrimp in our acoustic data collected all along the eastern seaboard. They tend to remain on the seafloor, and tend to avoid mudflats and seagrass habitats. Snapping shrimp produce quick snaps that appear as broad-frequency lines in the background of spectrogram images. We cannot distinguish snapping shrimp species by this type of data.
