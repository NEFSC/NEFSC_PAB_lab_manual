# Odontocetes: Typically 10 \- 170 kHz

In this section, we organize our odontocete species list by Sperm whale, Delphinidae (broadband, 30-50 kHz peak, and blackfish), Beaked whales, and narrow high-band frequency species (Porpoise, Kogiidae). Each section includes call types, spectra imagery, and wigner plots if applicable. Below is a figure differentiating inter-click-interval ranges of these odontocete groups.

## **Dolphins (Broadband, 30- 50 kHz peak, Blackfish)**

Dolphinid and blackfish species produce various clicks and whistles. Dolphinid specie/click pairings are usually ground truthed used visual pairing techniques such as towed arrays. Due to the difficulty of pairing dolphinid species with their clicks, NEFSC PAB groups dolphin call types together using the following list. Whistles are more easily distinguished between species \- spectrograms are included under each specie.  
   
Call types across dolphin groups:

* Odontocete buzz  
  * Dolphin buzzes   
  * Code: ODBZ  
* Odontocete impulsive  
  * Dolphin clicks   
  * Code: ODCLICK  
* Odontocete mixed calls  
  * When there’s a mix of whistles, clicks, burst pulses, etc. for dolphins  
  * Code: ODMIX  
* Odontocete whistle  
  * Dolphin whistles   
  * Code: ODWHIS  
* Odontocete burst pulse  
  * Dolphin burse pulses   
  * Code: ODBP

### *Blackfish*

Along with belugas and narwhales, blackfish can biphonate \- produce multiple frequencies at once. This is observed in their pulsed calls (example below), and is used in species identification. A click spectra for NEFSC PAB blackfish species is included below.

*Spectrographic example of a pilot whale pulsed call. Calls may consist of two components, an upper frequency component (UFC) that is a narrow-band tone, and a lower frequency component (LFC) that is a broadband pulse. The pulse repetition rate (PRR) is reflected by the sideband interval (SBI). Elements are distinguished by abrupt shifts in the PRR (Nemiroff & Whitehead 2009).*

## [**Narrow high-band frequency**](/content/Analysis/Species_list/Acoustic_events/Odont/Narrow_band.qmd)

Narrow high-band frequency species include porpoises and Kogiidae species (Pygmy and Dwarf sperm whales). Both groups produce indifferentiable clicks (shown in Wigner plot). Clicks are differentiated by recording location \- nearshore narrow high-band frequency clicks are denoted as porpoise clicks, offshore as Kogiidae clicks (map below). Porpoises also produce buzzes. 

Call types across high-band frequency group:

* Narrow band high frequency click  
  * Narrow band high frequency clicks used by kogia and porpoises   
  * Code: NBHF
