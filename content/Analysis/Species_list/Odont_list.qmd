title: Odontocetes
---

Life in the ocean provides unique navigational, foraging, and socializing challenges for marine mammals, for which they have adapted complex communication systems. This continuum of vocalization complexity spans from tonal (continuous sounds likely consisting of frequency modulation) to pulsed (short, rapid burst sounds) sounds. Tonal sounds are strongly linked to socializing events, while pulsed sounds are typically linked to foraging events. However, since nature does not like to conform to anthropogenic definitions, there are plenty of exceptions in odontocete call types and purposes.


**Foraging calls**\
While all members of the cetacean family exhibit complex communication, odontocetes have evolved a unique tool that baleen whales do not possess; echolocation. Odontocetes possess gelatinous material in their melon (in front of their blowhole) that can emit far-traveling soundwaves. These sounds bounce off their target and reflect back to the odontocete, providing valuable information about prey location/ environmental topography, ex. These pulsed calls are called described as '**clicks**', and are strongly linked to foraging events. Foraging odontocetes also produce '**buzz**' sounds, which is when echolocation clicks are so close together it sounds like buzzing. Different odontocete groups have varying click interval ranges (see below), used to help identify the sound source on spectrograms.

**Social calls**\
Many odontocetes exhibit socializing calls, including **whistles** and **burst pulses**. Whistles are one of the most studied odontocete vocalizations, and are frequency modulated, narrow-band calls. Many dolphin species adopt a 'signature whistle' in their first few years of life, and is variable based their environment/population. Burst pulses are another social call-type. These are high-frequency pulsed calls, which are emitted quickly and typically broadband. However, they can be difficult to describe as they are incredibly variable. Depending on the species, burst pulses can be described as creaks, squacks, barks, and pops. It is important to note, not all species whistle/and or produce burst pulses.

See our odontocete study species below for more information. Our species list is organizaed by sperm whale, dolphins, beaked whales, and narrow band high-frequency (NBHF) species (Porpoise, Kogiidae). Each section includes call types, spectra imagery, and wigner plots if applicable.

Sperm whales are grouped separate from other odontocetes due to their unique communication structure. They do exhibit foraging vocalizations (clicks and foraging buzz - also called 'creaks') similar to other odontocete groups. Sperm whale creaks are emitted during foraging, typically right before prey capture. However, they do not whistle. Their social vocalization types include **codas**, **clicks/clangs**, **Trumpets** and **social buzzes**. 

Codas are a specific arrangement of broadband clicks, and are thought to be used for group cohesion during dispersed foraging trips. Each sperm whale group has a different coda structure, and as such serves as a group-specific vocalization type. Slow clicks are typically produced by males, are thought to be used for long-distance communication. The unique nature of sperm whale calls is the fact that their diverse and complex language structure is strictly assembled by click variations. Below is a list of vocalizations monitored by the PAB.

*Atlantic Spotted Dolphin Whistles*

### Dolphin clicks
Our delphinid study species are grouped by click characteristics: Broadband, 30-50 kHz peak, and low-frequency high-amplitude (blackfish). 

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

Broadband species produce clicks with a wide frequency range, and consists of Bottlenose and Common dolphins. 

The second delphinid group is characterized by clicks with an amplitude peak within the 30 - 50 kHz frequency range. See right figure for 30-50 kHz peak click spectra and species composition. 

The final delphinid group are characterized by low frequency, high amplitude clicks. These are our blackfish species, which are also our largest delphinid species - false killer whales and pilot whales. Blackfish, along with belugas and narwhals, are unique in their ability to biphonate- produce multiple frequency sounds simultaneously. This occurs in their pulsed calls (see below). 


![*Spectrographic example of a pilot whale pulsed call. Calls may consist of two components, an upper frequency component (UFC) that is a narrow-band tone, and a lower frequency component (LFC) that is a broadband pulse. The pulse repetition rate (PRR) is reflected by the sideband interval (SBI). Elements are distinguished by abrupt shifts in the PRR (Nemiroff & Whitehead 2009).*](/figs/Spec_images/Odont/Odont_diagrams/Blackfish_biphonate.png){width=100%}

## [**Beaked Whales**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jmSdKaUpwv5Lui58kiEnyna--rEQR0AN_8fVNjgjkT0/edit?usp=sharing)

Beaked whales produce two types of clicks - Frequency modulated upsweeps and surface clicks (not frequency modulated). Frequency modulated upsweeps refers to echolocation clicks produced during foraging events. Similar to sperm whales, beaked whales produce buzzes(rapid echolocation clicks) right before prey capture. [**WHAT IS FREQUENCY MODULATION?**]. Some beaked whale species emit impulsive clicks, which are considered social communication. These are predominantly larger beaked whale species (ex. Northern bottlenose whale and Baird's beaked whales). Some species may produce whistles as well, however they are uncommon and not well documented.

### Beaked whale clicks
:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
Each beaked whale specie in the northeast region have slightly different click structures, as shown below in a combined click spectra plot. Note, click forms on the spectra plot are average values, and individual clicks for each specie may differ slightly. Under each beacked whale specie is a Wigner plot, which is the primary tool for determining beaked whale species from a click. Wigner plots were made in Pamguard. For more information on this software, see our [software page](https://nefsc.github.io/NEFSC_PAB_lab_manual/content/Software/Software.html#pamguard).
