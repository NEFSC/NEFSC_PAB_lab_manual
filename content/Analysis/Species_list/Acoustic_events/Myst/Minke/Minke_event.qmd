# Minke Whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) \
# Acoustic Event Guide

*Note: While there are other minke whale call types described in the literature for other
populations, the NEFSC Passive Acoustics Branch only uses pulse trains for determining daily
presence of minke whales in our archival data collected in the western North Atlantic. The
detection data for minke whales has not yet been added to our Passive Acoustic Cetacean Map
(PACM), therefore a map of their acoustic detections is not included in this guide at this time.*

### General
\
The information published on minke whale vocalizations is currently limited. In the Southern
and Pacific oceans they make a variety of low- and mid-frequency calls, but the most frequent
vocalization observed in the Atlantic Ocean are low-frequency pulse trains.

* Pulse Trains:
  + Stereotyped, 50-500 Hz thumps or pulses, each lasting ~0.5-0.7 s 
  + Pulse trains can last 40-60 s and occur every 6-14 minutes in bouts that can last
up to several hours
  + Some pulse trains have pulses that remain at a constant interpulse interval (IPI),
while other pulse trains show a slight but abrupt slow-down in pulses and
lengthening of IPI approximately halfway through the pulse train (Risch et al.,
2013; see Fig. 2a). There are also speed-up pulse trains that show the reverse
trend with decreasing IPIs toward the end of the pulse train.
  + Minkes are also known to create variations of pulse trains, with seasonal
variation in pulse train length and IPIs (see Fig. 4, 5, and 6).

When analyzing data for minke whale pulse trains, it is important to keep in mind that
haddock (fish) can produce knocking/thumping sounds (see Fig. 7) that can individually
resemble minke whale pulses. Most minke whale pulse trains are at least 20 seconds long, and
can last up to 60 seconds, whereas haddock knock sequences are generally shorter in duration
and may last only a few seconds. Haddock knock sequences may also occur much closer
together and even blur into a humming sound if there are many individuals knocking
simultaneously. Minke whales generally have an interval of 6-14 minutes between their pulse
trains, although shorter intervals may be observed if there are multiple individuals.
\

Additionally, both minke whales and haddock show strong diel trends in their sound
production but at different times of year. During the peak season of July to November, minke
whales have been shown to produce the vast majority of their pulse trains during the twilight
and nighttime hours (see Fig. 1). Haddock also generally produce more knocks at night,
especially by males during their spawning season of January to June.
\

Minke whales are more likely to be detected from July to November in the Stellwagen Bank
National Marine Sanctuary (SBNMS), with detections peaking in the August-October period.
They are usually not detected in January and February, and rarely detected from March to June.
Visual sightings data generally aligns with the acoustic detection data, indicating that the SBNMS may be a transitory location for minke whales as they migrate along the U.S. and Canadian east coasts. The lack of acoustic detections in the spring may suggest that they migrate further offshore on their northbound migration to their summer feeding grounds.
