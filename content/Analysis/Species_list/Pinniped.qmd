Gray seals produce various vocalizations and acoustic signaling. Nonvocal behaviors range from surface interactions, such as breaching/porpoising, to underwater 'claps' or knocks (Hocking et al., 2019). Nowak, 2021 describes variable gray seal calls, with characteristics ranging from:

**Frequency modulated above and sub-surface vocalziations (S1, tonal, 400 - 420 Hz)**

\
**A series of short bursts with no tonal components (S2, only occurring underwater and by male seals, 45 - 50 Hz)**

\
**A series of short, pulses with harmonic components (S3, explicitly water-born vocalizations, frequencies between 50 - 160 Hz)**

\

Seal claps are unique in the aspect that they have a greater frequency range than seal vocalizations. Claps are thought to be part of social and/or antagonistic interactions (below).
