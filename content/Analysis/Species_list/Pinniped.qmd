## **Gray seal**

**Scientific name**: *Halichoerus grypus*  
**Code**: GRSE

Gray seals produce various vocalizations and acoustic signaling. Nonvocal behaviors range from surface interactions, such as breaching/porpoising, to underwater 'claps' or knocks (Hocking et al., 2019).

### Vocalizations

Nowak, 2021 describes the following variability in gray seal calls:

**S1**: Frequency modulated above and sub-surface vocalizations (tonal, 400 - 420 Hz) - example was recorded on the surface.

\
**S2**: A series of short bursts with no tonal components (only occurring underwater and by male seals, 45 - 50 Hz) - example was recorded underwater.

**S3**: A series of short, pulses with harmonic components (explicitly water-born vocalizations, frequencies between 50 - 160 Hz) - example was recorded underwater.

### Nonvocal acoustics

Seal claps are unique in the aspect that they have a greater frequency range than seal vocalizations. Claps are thought to be part of social and/or antagonistic interactions (below).
